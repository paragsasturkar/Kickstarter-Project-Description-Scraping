      "THE STORY.\n",
      "This is a book for doubters and believers, but mainly doubters. If you're anything like me, at some point in time, you've been disheartened by how people sometimes represent Christ. You've had different portrayals of Jesus given to you. But how do you know which is the true picture of Jesus? Somewhere in the mess of this noisy world is the true picture of Jesus, and with the help of Scripture and personal experiences, we will discover together how Jesus should really be represented on this Earth.\n",
      "In \"How We've Changed Jesus,\" each chapter will present a picture of Jesus that I encountered somewhere in my life. Examples include: The Hipster Jesus, The Political Jesus, The Slandering Jesus, and The Extroverted Jesus, and many more!\n",
      "Partner with me on this mission and we'll show that with a little help from friends giving to a good cause, we can change the world.\n",
      "An example chapter includes The Angry Jesus!\n",
      "An example chapter includes The Masculine Jesus!\n",
      "BACKGROUND.\n",
      "I have always been enchanted with the craft of story-telling and its ability to draw us from reality and give us a deeper perspective on how we see the world. I always dreamed that I could one day partake in this culture of writing. But I never imagined my time would come so soon.\n",
      "In the Spring of 2011, my heart was set ablaze for full-time ministry. Ever since then I have been striving for that endeavor. This goal has added a new meaning to my ability to write. I realized that if I'm going to write, it is always going to be for the purpose of expanding Christ's Kingdom on this Earth.\n",
      "Yet, as I have discovered, the world is not so keen on fully embracing the message of Christ. For these past two years, I have been trying to solve this riddle of \"why not?\" Why can't they see what I see?\n",
      "I soon realized that it was all because of perceptions. Perceptions have a nasty way of holding people back from embracing anything. All it takes is one bad perception to poison the well. This is what happened to Christianity within our culture. We have gotten a bad rep, not so much because of the truth we adhere to, but rather by the way we handle that truth. In our inability to handle the truth in a Christ-like manner, we fail to represent Christ to a broken world.\n",
      "So I started doing what I naturally do. I start writing. I started a blog which spoke on issues which we have failed to represent the Scriptural Christ in. The blog became an instant hit. Soon after that, I started publishing my writings to magazines. But at the end of the day, I knew I wasn't fully reaching my potential.\n",
      "That was until now. A story idea of mine that would link all my writings was picked up by Prodigal Press. With them, I plan on releasing my book in April 2014, but that is dependent on if I can get the money or not. If I could get enough money, my message of how we need to better represent Christ could impact millions. \n",
      "My dream is not only my dream. It is a dream for the body of Christ. We can band together and be an unstoppable force for good, a movement for love, and a catapult for change. All it takes is for a community to encourage one another to take that risky first step. And hopefully, this book will be one of many steps in the right direction for Christ's Kingdom.\n",
      "So will you contribute? Let's move forward together and impact culture with this book!\n",
      "Risks and challenges\n",
      "-People might believe that I am not capable of writing a story like this. It is a responsibility that I understand though. I am not writing this book to offend people in the faith or not in the faith. This story is more of a personal account that I believe can help people better understand the character of Jesus.\n",
      "With that being said, here is a short excerpt of what I believe: I believe Jesus Christ is Lord and Savior of our lives. The Bible is the word of God. The church can be defined by those who confess Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior.\n",
      "That is the foundation with which I write this book.\n",
      "-If the money is not all gathered by the deadline, then the book will become impossible to publish. And I am operating on a very short deadline. So it might just happen that I might not reach the amount I need within the time I need it by. But that is okay because it gives me hope to see that even a small group of people are willing to stand up for good and enact a positive change for society.\n",

      "THE STORY.\n",
      "This is a book for doubters and believers, but mainly doubters. If you're anything like me, at some point in time, you've been disheartened by how people sometimes represent Christ. You've had different portrayals of Jesus given to you. But how do you know which is the true picture of Jesus? Somewhere in the mess of this noisy world is the true picture of Jesus, and with the help of Scripture and personal experiences, we will discover together how Jesus should really be represented on this Earth.\n",
      "In \"How We've Changed Jesus,\" each chapter will present a picture of Jesus that I encountered somewhere in my life. Examples include: The Hipster Jesus, The Political Jesus, The Slandering Jesus, and The Extroverted Jesus, and many more!\n",
      "Partner with me on this mission and we'll show that with a little help from friends giving to a good cause, we can change the world.\n",
      "An example chapter includes The Angry Jesus!\n",
      "An example chapter includes The Masculine Jesus!\n",
      "BACKGROUND.\n",
      "I have always been enchanted with the craft of story-telling and its ability to draw us from reality and give us a deeper perspective on how we see the world. I always dreamed that I could one day partake in this culture of writing. But I never imagined my time would come so soon.\n",
      "In the Spring of 2011, my heart was set ablaze for full-time ministry. Ever since then I have been striving for that endeavor. This goal has added a new meaning to my ability to write. I realized that if I'm going to write, it is always going to be for the purpose of expanding Christ's Kingdom on this Earth.\n",
      "Yet, as I have discovered, the world is not so keen on fully embracing the message of Christ. For these past two years, I have been trying to solve this riddle of \"why not?\" Why can't they see what I see?\n",
      "I soon realized that it was all because of perceptions. Perceptions have a nasty way of holding people back from embracing anything. All it takes is one bad perception to poison the well. This is what happened to Christianity within our culture. We have gotten a bad rep, not so much because of the truth we adhere to, but rather by the way we handle that truth. In our inability to handle the truth in a Christ-like manner, we fail to represent Christ to a broken world.\n",
      "So I started doing what I naturally do. I start writing. I started a blog which spoke on issues which we have failed to represent the Scriptural Christ in. The blog became an instant hit. Soon after that, I started publishing my writings to magazines. But at the end of the day, I knew I wasn't fully reaching my potential.\n",
      "That was until now. A story idea of mine that would link all my writings was picked up by Prodigal Press. With them, I plan on releasing my book in April 2014, but that is dependent on if I can get the money or not. If I could get enough money, my message of how we need to better represent Christ could impact millions. \n",
      "My dream is not only my dream. It is a dream for the body of Christ. We can band together and be an unstoppable force for good, a movement for love, and a catapult for change. All it takes is for a community to encourage one another to take that risky first step. And hopefully, this book will be one of many steps in the right direction for Christ's Kingdom.\n",
      "So will you contribute? Let's move forward together and impact culture with this book!\n",
      "Risks and challenges\n",
      "-People might believe that I am not capable of writing a story like this. It is a responsibility that I understand though. I am not writing this book to offend people in the faith or not in the faith. This story is more of a personal account that I believe can help people better understand the character of Jesus.\n",
      "With that being said, here is a short excerpt of what I believe: I believe Jesus Christ is Lord and Savior of our lives. The Bible is the word of God. The church can be defined by those who confess Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior.\n",
      "That is the foundation with which I write this book.\n",
      "-If the money is not all gathered by the deadline, then the book will become impossible to publish. And I am operating on a very short deadline. So it might just happen that I might not reach the amount I need within the time I need it by. But that is okay because it gives me hope to see that even a small group of people are willing to stand up for good and enact a positive change for society.\n",

      "This book doesn't just talk about an idea, Scott reveals HOW to attract your ideal client and implement a lead to sales conversion strategy. Because selling your services in todays world has changed. No longer can you hard sell or use clever sales techniques. \n",
      "Scott is an inspirational marketing mentor who has added over £30m turnover to clients he has worked with.\n",
      "In this book Scott goes through in detail the three key parts of his marketing strategy that puts him, and his numerous clients, in the position of never having to sell himself or his services.\n",
      "This strategy enhances the relationships with his clients so that they are no longer 'transactional' relationships and as a result they pay for services again and again and again without Scott ever selling.\n",
      "YOUR CLIENT VISION is where all your marketing should start from.  Imagine someone asking you \"what do you do?\" and when you reply they say to you \"we need to have a chat.\"  This is what your client vision does, and in such a powerful way that your ideal client is desperate to know more about you and your services.\n",
      "The 'It All Starts With Your Client Vision' book breaks down the three aspects you need to attract your ideal client and get them to buy from you again and again without ever selling to them. Stage three of this is something that 98% of businesses don't do!\n",
